        <h3>Hello and welcome to Books of Yesterday,</h3>
        <p />
        I love to find really good books, books that support scriptural principles
        and are well written.
        Since so many good books are out-of-print, I'm often going to auctions
        or searching the internet, and I visit
        used book stores wherever I travel around the country.
        <p />
        I'm sure you appreciate the value of a good book, especially for
        raising your children.  The books I have listed in my catalog are selected
        specifically with home-educating families in mind.
        However, they are for anyone who is interested in finding and preserving good
        books for their children and grandchildren.
        Incidentally, that is just how I got started:  finding good out-of-print
        books to have for my own children and grandchildren.
        <p />
        Many of the titles in my catalog are taken from recommended reading lists
        of various home-school enthusiasts.  Many of them I have read and
        thoroughly enjoyed, but I certainly have not read all of them.  I firmly
        believe that a good children's book is even better when read as an
        adult.
        <p />
        In any case, I hope you will browse and enjoy.  And if you purchase a book you
        don't care for, I will be happy to take it back.
        <p />

        Thanks,  Jan
